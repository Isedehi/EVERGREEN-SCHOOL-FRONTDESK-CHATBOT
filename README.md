## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. **User Input** is cleaned, tokenized, and corrected.
2. **Synonym Matching** checks for keywords and their variants.
3. **Intent Prediction** uses both rule-based and ML-based scoring.
4. **Response Generation** pulls from CSV datasets or custom handlers.
5. **Fallback Logic** handles unknown inputs with sentiment-aware replies.
6. **Exit Detection** gracefully ends the chat when the user is done.
